    \item Slide: What are errors?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Pilots make on average 3-6 ``errors'' per hour on the flight deck
        \item Unintended deviation from a preferred behavior
    \end{itemize}
    \item Slide: What is the preferred behavior?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Often assessed from our own behaviors
        \item Often biased by complacency
        \item Determined by the community (peers/standards/best practices)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Slide: Human Error

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Skill based error (``slips'') - example: logic bug.  Hard to prevent other than over-practice.
        \item Lapses of memory (``lapses'') - example: syntax bug.  Use of checks such as CI, regression tests, linters.
        \item Mistakes - think you are doing the right thing, but it is the wrong thing.  Requires understanding of ``right'' to trap and mitigate.  Checklists and standards can help, but they need to be standard!
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Rule based mistakes
            \begin{itemize}
                \item You drive over the speed limit because you get where you are going faster, and you get a ticket - bad rule that usually works
                \item Incorrectly programmed a new infusion pump following the directions used for an older model and the pump failed - good rule in wrong situation
            \end{itemize}
            \item Knowledge based mistakes
            \begin{itemize}
                \item You apply an incorrect technique using concepts you aren't familiar with
                \item You misdiagnose a bug and take inappropriate action to correct it
                \item You react incorrectly to a bug based on an incomplete understanding of the system
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        \item Routine violation - everyone is doing it, so I'll do it.  Example: speeding.
        \item Situation violation - need to do this to make progress.  Example: overriding GitHub merge requirements
        \item Exceptional violation - no thought or care for the consequences.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Slide: Addressing Human Error
    
    Design systems where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Likelihood of making an error is reduced
        \item Motivation for making violations is reduced
        \item When failures occur, we can do something about it
    \end{itemize}

    \item Slide: Quote
    \begin{quote}
        Safety is not just the absence of accidents and incidents, but rather the presence of barriers and defenses and the capacity of the system to fail safely - Todd Conklin
    \end{quote}
    \item Slide: Normalization of Deviance

    Why do violations occur?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Always looking to be more efficient/effective
        \item Standards and best practices vs. efficiency and effectiveness
        \item Erosion of safety margins
        \item Most of the time, no adverse outcomes
    \end{itemize}

    \item Slide: How can we empower everyone to bring up errors?

    Psychological Safety - a shared belief within the team that it is safe to take interpersonal risks

    \item Slide: Psychological Safety
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Inclusion - make everyone feel welcome
        \item Learner Safety - normalize making mistakes, depersonalize feedback.  Focus on observable actions, not about individuals
        \item Contributor Safety - normalize different approaches and novel contributions.  Not ``we've always done it this way''
        \item Challenger Safety - normalize raising concerns.
        
    \end{itemize}
    Leaders - ask for help, highlight own mistakes, be human

    \item Slide: Just Culture
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Everyone is fallible, errors will happen
        \item However, willful negligence still needs to be held to account
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{quote}
        [Just culture is] an atmosphere of trust in which people are encouraged (even rewarded) for providing essential information, but in which the line must be drawn between acceptable and unacceptable behavior.
    \end{quote}

    \item Slide: Just Culture
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Context-rich stories
        \item Detailed analysis
        \item Evaluate rules
        \item Share learnings
        \item Apply rules in new situations
        \item Repeat
    \end{itemize}

    \item Slide: Just Culture in Medicine

    \item Slide: Sources of Errors
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Skills-based (1:10000) - errors associated with distractions.  Improve through deliberate practice - perfect practice makes perfect.
        \item Rules-based (1:100) - errors associated with applying wrong rule.  Improve through exposure to different situations with subtle differences to emphasize applicability of rules.
        \item Knowledge based (1:2) - errors associated with lack of experience/knowledge.  Improve by providing method/philosophy of approaching problems.
    \end{itemize}

    \item Activity: Case Study
\end{enumerate}
